This short project is about using supervised machine learning to predict credit card approvals from various labeled data.  In this project I use a dataset from UC Irving to develop and test two Machine Learning models and select the one with the highest predictive accuracy (90%).  This is a DataCamp.com project assignment which I have saved to my github.  Feel free to visit my profile at https://www.datacamp.com/portfolio/mountaintr to see more of my courses, tracks and projects.
